Assuming we know the following facts:

{{history}}

and that you have to answer the `question`: "{{question}}"

Reformulate the `question` or even give the answer if you can deduce it 
from the previous facts.

Use the following format for your output:

newQuestion: "Your reformulated question"

Or if you have found the answer inside the history use the format:

Final Answer: "The answer is in the history and is '<interpolate here what you have found>'"
